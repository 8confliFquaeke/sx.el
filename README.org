=stack-mode= hopes to be a fully-featured Stack Exchange mode for
Emacs 24+ using version 2.2 (and subsequent versions as available) of
the Stack Exchange API.

This README will eventually hold a high-level feature list and details
on installation and configuration.
* Contributing
Please do, but note that the repository history is likely to be
rebased on a single commit once v0.1 is reached.  Things at this stage
are volatile and highly experimental, so the codebase changes quickly
and sometimes arbitrarily.

The best way to contribute right now is via discussion.  Open an issue
describing a feature you'd like (That isn't already listed) or a
package you think would come in handy.

For a better view of all of the open issues, take a look at our lovely
[[http://www.waffle.io/vermiculus/stack-mode][Waffle board]]!  Feel free to take the torch on anything in =backlog= or
=ready=.  If you have thoughts on any other issues, don't hesitate to
chime in!

** Question Viewing
It's not terribly clear how this whould be approached, but I have in
the past assumed using an Org-mode-like buffer (with special bindings)
that includes the question and all answers and comments.  This is
likely to evolve as the project better understands what it is.

Whatever the format, the user will be able to archive the question for
offline reference.
** Question Browsing
If point is on a question:

The information displays (and its format) will be customizable using
format strings and special markers.
** Question Asking
** Commenting
With a pop-up buffer similar to =twittering-mode=.
** Not Planned
The following features are not currently planned for this mode,
regardless of API support.  This is mostly because I have no idea what
I'm doing.

** Icon
Stack Exchange Mode for Emacs has no explicit use for an icon,
although standard SVG files have been gathered in =resources/= if
anyone would fancy a crack at it.
