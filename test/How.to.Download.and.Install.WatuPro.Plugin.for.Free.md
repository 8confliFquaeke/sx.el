# How to Download and Install WatuPro Plugin for Free
 
WatuPro is a premium WordPress plugin that allows you to create exams, tests, quizzes, surveys and more on your website. It is a versatile and powerful tool that can help you in education, research, marketing, data analysis and user engagement. However, the plugin is not free and costs $47 for a single site license. If you want to use WatuPro without paying for it, you might be tempted to look for a nulled version of the plugin.

A nulled plugin is a pirated copy of a premium plugin that has been modified to bypass the license verification and activation process. Nulled plugins are often distributed on shady websites that claim to offer them for free or for a very low price. However, using a nulled plugin is not only illegal but also risky. Here are some of the dangers of using a nulled plugin:
 
- **Malware infection:** Nulled plugins may contain hidden malicious code that can infect your website and compromise its security. Malware can steal your sensitive data, redirect your visitors to spammy sites, display unwanted ads, or even take over your site completely.
- **Lack of updates and support:** Nulled plugins do not receive any updates or support from the original developers. This means that you will miss out on new features, bug fixes and security patches that are essential for keeping your site running smoothly and safely. You will also have no access to technical assistance or documentation if you encounter any issues with the plugin.
- **Legal issues:** Nulled plugins are illegal and violate the intellectual property rights of the original developers. By using a nulled plugin, you are exposing yourself to potential lawsuits and fines. You are also harming the WordPress community by depriving the developers of their deserved income and discouraging them from creating more quality products.

As you can see, using a nulled plugin is not worth the risk. If you want to use WatuPro on your website, you should purchase a legitimate license from the official website[^2^]. This way, you will get access to all the features and benefits of the plugin, as well as regular updates and support. You will also support the development of WatuPro and help it grow and improve.
 
If you are still looking for a way to use WatuPro for free, there is an alternative option. You can try out the free version of WatuPro called Watu[^2^], which has some basic features of the premium plugin. You can use Watu to create simple quizzes and tests on your website and see how it works. If you like it, you can upgrade to WatuPro later and enjoy its full functionality.
