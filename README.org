StackMode will be a full featured Stack Exchange mode for GNU Emacs 24
and up. Using the official API, we aim to create a more versatile
experience for the Stack Exchange network within Emacs itself.

* Features
- ~list-questions~ ::
     List questions on a StackExchange site.
- Viewing Posts ::
  - Use =jknp= to open questions from within ~list-questions~; use
    =RET= to move focus.
  - Use =v= to open the site in your browser.
  - Use =TAB= to fold questions and answers.
** Planned
- Archiving questions for offline access
- Browsing and favoriting networks
- Advanced searching
- Writing questions, answers, and comments (with source code in its
  native major mode)
- Notifications
- Reputation reporting
- ...

Have a feature in mind that isn't on the list?  Submit a pull request
to add it to the list!  If you want to discuss it first, pop in our
Gitter chatroom (badge above) -- someone will be around shortly to
talk about it.
* Installation
To install the development version, follow the usual steps:
- Clone this repository
- Add this directory to your ~load-path~
- Issue ~(require 'sx-question-list)~
This should give you access to the only entry point function at the
moment, ~list-questions~.

Eventually, this package will at least be available on MELPA.
Depending on community involvement, it may even be submitted to the
official GNU ELPA.

** Icons
Stack Exchange Mode for Emacs has no explicit use for an icon,
although standard SVG files have been gathered in =resources/= if
anyone would fancy a crack at it.
