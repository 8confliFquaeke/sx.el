SX will be a full featured Stack Exchange mode for GNU Emacs 24+.  Using the
official API, we aim to create a more versatile experience for the Stack
Exchange network within Emacs itself.

* Features
- ~sx-tab-frontpage~ ::
     List questions on a StackExchange site.
- Viewing Posts ::
  - Use =jknp= to open questions from within ~list-questions~; use
    =RET= to move focus.
  - Use =v= to open the object at point in your browser.
  - Use =TAB= to fold questions and answers.
  - Use =RET= to open a link at point.
  - Use =:= to switch sites.
  - Vote up and down with =u= and =d=.

** Planned
- Archiving questions for offline access
- Browsing and favoriting networks
- Advanced searching
- Writing questions, answers, and comments (with source code in its
  native major mode)
- Notifications
- Reputation reporting
- ...

Have a feature in mind that isn't on the list?  Submit a pull request
to add it to the list!  If you want to discuss it first, pop in our
Gitter chatroom (badge above) -- someone will be around shortly to
talk about it.

* Installation
To install the development version, follow the usual steps:
- Clone this repository
- Add this directory to your ~load-path~
- Issue ~(require 'sx)~
- Issue ~(require 'sx-tab)~
This should give you access to the only entry point function at the
moment, ~sx-tab-frontpage~.

Eventually, this package will be available on MELPA.

** Some Basic Controls
- =RET= :: interact with things under point (collapse headers, visit
           links, etc.)
- =TAB= :: go to next element
- =n= :: go to next section
- =p= :: go to previous section
- =j= :: go to next question, viewing it
- =k= :: go to previous question, viewing it
- =v= :: visit a question on the browser
- =w= :: copy things under point (usually a url)
- =e= :: edit
- =a= :: answer
- =c= :: comment
- =u= :: vote up
- =d= :: vote down

** Icons
SX has no explicit /need/ for an icon, although standard SVG files
have been gathered in =resources/= if anyone would fancy a crack at
it.
