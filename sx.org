* Introduction
SX is a StackExchange client for Emacs.  This means that it supports
many of the same features that the official web interface does, but in
a way that is /specialized/ for Emacs:

- question browsing for any site on the network
- asking, answering, and commenting
- advanced searching and filtering
- offline archiving
- inbox notifications
- ...

All of these features are implemented in a way that makes sense with
Emacs conventions.  Of course, the core convention of Emacs is
arbitrary customizability -- [[#hooks][hack away]]!

* Basic Usage
** Authenticating
Use ~sx-auth-authenticate~.  Calling this function will open up a
webpage on StackExchange that will prompt you to authorize this
application.  Once you do this, StackExchange will redirect you to our
own authorization landing page.  This landing page will prominently
display your access token.  (This is /your/ token -- keep this
private!)  Enter this token into Emacs.  Emacs will set and save it to
a cache file.

** Browsing Questions
To browse a list of questions retrieved from the site, use
~sx-tab-frontpage~.  This queries for a site, pulls the first page of
questions for that site, and displays them in a list.  

- Refresh the page with =g= or by scrolling past the top.
- Use =n=, =p=, =N=, =P= to navigate without viewing the question.
- =j=, =k=, =J=, =K= to do the same /with/ viewing the question.
- =RET= to open the question with Emacs.
- =v= to visit it with a browser.

Scrolling past the bottom of the list fetches more questions.

* List of Hooks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: hooks
  :END:

# Do not list internal hooks.  While they are useful, they should be
# used only by contributors.

- ~sx-init-hook~ :: Run when ~sx-initialize~ is called.

* Contributing
This document is maintained in Org format.  Updates to the source code
should be accompanied by updates to this document when user-facing
functionality is changed.

Note that some distinctions are made which may not be apparent when
viewing the document with Info.

** Markup Conventions
Markup is used consistently as follows:

- packages :: =package.el=
- keybinding :: =C-x C-s= (use ~kbd~ format)
- values :: =value=
- symbols :: =symbol=
- functions :: ~function~

To make the Info export readable, lists and source code blocks are
separated from body text with a blank line (as to start a new
paragraph).

** Document Attributes
Attributes should be given in uppercase:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (some elisp)
  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

** Source Code Blocks
The language for Emacs Lisp source code blocks should be given as
=elisp= and its content should be indented by two spaces.  See
~org-edit-src-content-indentation~.
